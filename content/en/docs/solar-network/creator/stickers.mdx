Stickers help users express their emotions better on Solar Network. This article introduces how to upload and use a sticker.

## Sticker Packs

Stickers must be part of a sticker pack. To create a sticker pack, go to the "Creator Hub" > "Stickers" section on the website sidebar.

## Stickers

Before creating a sticker, you’ll need to prepare the content. It is recommended to use a PNG or GIF image that is 1024x1024 pixels (minimum 128x128). The background can be transparent or not, but avoid solid color fills. Large white fills may cause discomfort for users in dark mode, akin to a flashbang.

Once the sticker pack is created, open it and select the plus symbol under "Actions" to add a sticker.

You might need to upload an attachment for the sticker material. After uploading, fill in the "Attachment" field with the Random ID (the series of characters after the #) from the completed upload. If the content displays correctly, the connection is successful.

After that, simply fill out the form to finish.

## Usage

To use a sticker, type a placeholder in your content, formatted as `:<pack prefix><sticker alias>:`.
For example, if a sticker pack has the prefix `solar` and a sticker alias `Hello`, the resulting placeholder would be `:solarHello:`.

Don’t worry if that seems confusing—most of the time, we provide automatic suggestions. Simply type a colon in the Solian text box, followed by part of the placeholder, and suggestions will appear.

### Size Variations

In Solar Network, you may notice stickers appear in different sizes due to Smart Resize. The rules are as follows:

1. If only one sticker is present, it will appear at 128x128.
2. If three or fewer stickers are present, they will appear at 32x32.
3. If more than three stickers are present, or if stickers are embedded within text, they will appear at 20x20.

These adjustments are applied within a single paragraph.
