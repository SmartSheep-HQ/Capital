Solian is the cross-platform Solar Network client built with Flutter, and currently, it’s our only frontend.

# Usage

To use Solian, you can either download the client or open it directly in your browser. Thanks to Flutter’s cross-platform support, you can access the web version of Solian at https://lian.solsynth.dev. However, due to browser limitations, some features may be missing or affected.

## Download

There are many ways to download Solsynth, but make sure to download from officially certified channels.

1. The official release version from the repository: https://git.solsynth.dev/Hydrogen/Solian/releases
2. The test version from the official file storage: https://files.solsynth.dev/production01/solian
3. Official TestFlight (iOS and some macOS): https://testflight.apple.com/join/YJ0lmN6O

The Windows version is a portable version. You can place it in a directory you're familiar with and run it directly.
The web version also supports PWA (Progressive Web Application), which can replace some desktop usage.

## Installation

Below are the technical instructions for installing Solian on different platforms.

### Android

It is recommended to download the latest test version from the **file storage**. It has the latest fixes and is the most stable. ~~The test version is more stable than the stable version.~~

You can open and install the downloaded APK file directly. For Chinese phones, additional steps may be required for verification, but please avoid searching for and downloading from built-in app stores.

### iOS/macOS

Use TestFlight for installation. First, click the link above to download the TestFlight app. Then, click "Start Testing" in the second step of the link to join the test.

TestFlight has a limited number of testing slots. Once the time is right, we will release Solian on the App Store (non-China region), where you can search and download it.

### Windows

After downloading from any trusted source, extract it to a directory, and you can start using it.

**Note:** It seems that, due to a potential Flutter support issue, the Windows version often freezes for a while during the first startup before displaying the main window. Please be patient and avoid clicking repeatedly, as it may take 5 to 30 seconds. Repeated clicking may open multiple windows.

### Linux

Please build it yourself. I believe you can do it — good luck!

## Build It Yourself

### Preparing the Environment

Building Solian requires the Flutter SDK. Please download the latest version from the official site. Alternatively, you can download it from a China mirror.
After installing Flutter, follow the official documentation to install other platform-specific dependencies (e.g., Windows requires VS2022, Android requires Android Studio, and for iOS/macOS, it’s better to use the official pre-built version).

In addition to installing the Flutter SDK, we need Rust for system-level dependencies. Please download the latest version from the official Rust site.

Now that we have Flutter and Rust, we need one more thing — SQLite3, to support local databases for chat and future modules.
For Linux, you need to install the corresponding SQLite3 development dependencies:

```sh
# for ubuntu
sudo apt-get -y install libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev
```

For Windows, download the
[sqlite3.dll](https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite/raw/master/sqflite_common_ffi/lib/src/windows/sqlite3.dll)
and place it in the running directory.
No additional steps are needed for macOS or mobile builds.

### Building the Code

Next, it’s time to build the code. Ensure that you have `git` installed on your build machine. Alternatively, you can download the code as a compressed archive.
Once `git` is installed, use the following command to clone the code:

```sh
git clone https://git.solsynth.dev/Hydrogen/Solian.git
```

Navigate to the corresponding directory and install dependencies using the following command:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

This will download dependencies from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev), hosted by Google. Connectivity within mainland China might be questionable. Refer to mirror sites for solutions.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can proceed with the build. Just one line of code:

```sh
# for windows
flutter build windows
# for macos
flutter build macos
# for linux
flutter build linux
# for ios
flutter build ipa
# for android
flutter build apk
```

You can also build other formats for Android, such as `aab`, but please prepare the necessary signing materials yourself.
