Solar Network is a social network developed by Solsynth LLC, aiming to become the next-generation social network.

## Tech Stack

The Solar Network project follows the classic frontend-backend separation architecture, with the entire project divided into two parts: the frontend (Solian) and the backend (Hydrogen.Dealer, Hydrogen.Passport, etc.).

### Frontend

The frontend of Solar Network is a cross-platform client built with Flutter. For more details, check the [related page](solar-network/solian).

### Backend

The backend of Solar Network follows what we define as a "mid-service" architecture. Compared to microservices, each individual service is responsible for more tasks and is larger in scope, allowing us to maintain multiple projects more easily. At the same time, issues with a single service won't cause an overall outage.

At the center of it all is our core service â€” Hydrogen.Dealer, which serves as both the service discovery system and mid-service gateway. It is also the only external interface for Solar Network, with `api.sn.solsynth.dev` being the gateway exposed by Hydrogen.Dealer.
