Welcome to the Solsynth library!

The Solsynth Database, also known as the Sun Archive, is the largest known repository of Solsynth LLC products. It is operated by Solsynth LLC. Content and resources are provided by the community, with official oversight and corrections.

We are still building the archive, but in the future all of our materials will be available here.

You can contribute to our documentation by Forking our [Capital](https://git.solsynth.dev/Goatworks/Capital) to edit files within `content/<lang>/docs` and submit PRs.
Whether it's adding new content, fixing something that's incorrect, feel free to contribute.

*P.S. You can use Solarpass to log in to the Solsynth Code Repository with a single click.*
