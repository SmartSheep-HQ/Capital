description: The HTTP server that powered us. Great ability, and easy to use

RoadSign is an HTTP server developed by Solsynth LLC.
Its support for HTTP protocol is not excellent, but it is definitely handy for accelerating your project deployment!
It even made us abandon Netlify and Vercel.

## Highlight Features

- RoadSign CLI deploys projects with one line of command
- Full control over your traffic
- Featured Transformer to modify requests
- Built-in Warden thread management

## Installation

It is recommended to use docker for installation. The following is an example docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  roadsign:
    image: xsheep2010/roadsign:delta
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
      - 81:81
    volumes:
      - "/srv/roadsign/config:/config"
      - "/srv/roadsign/workdir:/workdir"
      - "/srv/roadsign/settings.toml:/settings.toml"
```

It is recommended to have RoadSign behind a real reverse proxy, so do not listen to 443 and 80 here, use 8000 to let the reverse proxy do the upstream.
Port 81 is the management API port that the side-loading API needs to use, which can be changed in the settings.

It is also recommended to install RoadSign CLI on your local machine

```sh
$ npm i -g roadsign-cli
```
