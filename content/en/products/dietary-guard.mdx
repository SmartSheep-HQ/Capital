A simple app to look up the ingredients of your food,
with a little something along the way to keep you from eating something you shouldn't eat and going to the hospital.

## Highlight

1. Get authoritative and accurate food nutritional data via USDA FoodData Central API.
2. Customize the alert rules to know at a glance what food is not suitable for you to eat.
3. Simple and easy to use
4. Lightweight software, less than 8M.
