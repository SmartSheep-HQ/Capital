Another Spotify third-party client. Multi-platform support, as it is built using Flutter.

The project is inspired and supported by [spotube](https://spotube.krtirtho.dev).
Their original app is good enough. But I just want to redesign the UI and make it ready to add more features and more backend support.

## Highlights

Compared to the original spotube. The project adds more audio sources, such as Netease Cloud Music, Kugou, and provides the ability to use it in mainland China.

The project also focuses on the playback experience of VOCALOID songs.
We improved the search and ranking algorithms so that queries will select fewer cover versions in favor of the original.

Due to the termination of jiosaavn's service in Asia (other regions may also be affected). We removed the jiosaavn audio source.

## Roadmap

Seet at [GitHub](https://github.com/Solsynth/RhythmBox) or [Solsynth Git Repository](https://git.solsynth.dev/LittleSheep/RhythmBox)
