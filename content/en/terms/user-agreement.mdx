## Resource Misuse Prevention Policy

Although there are no capacity limitations for using Solar Network's data hosting services, resources determined to be abusive will be disenfranchised from some features.
Solsynth LLC reserves the right to reclaim space on previously uploaded resources for deletion.

### Determination of Misuse

- Uploading without using: e.g. uploading excessive attachments in Solar Network's Interactive Attachment Pool and not linking them to posts.
- Meaningless Posts: meaningless shuffling or wasting of Solar Network's storage resources
- Misuse: using Solar Network's public resources as if they were your own dedicated pool (see the Wiki's Dedicated Pools page for details).

The Solsynth Trust & Safety Team is ultimately responsible for determining misuse.
